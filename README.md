# Linear_Regression_MachineLearning

## What is Linear Regression?

*Linear regression is a statistical method used in machine learning to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to predict the outcome of feature events.*

## Workflow of the Linear Regression Model

Step 1: Set the learning rate and number of iterations ; Initiate Random weight and Bias value

Step 2: Build Linear Regression Equation ( Y = m * X + b )

Step 3: Find the " Y_Pred " value for the given X value for the corresponding weight & bias.

Step 4: Check the Loss Function for these parameters ( Difference between "Y_Pred" & "True Y" )

Step 5: Update the parameters using Gradient Descent ( New Weight & Bais Value ) 

Step 6: Repeat Steps 3, 4, and 5 till we get the minimum Loss Function.

Finally Model will best fit with minimum loss function.
